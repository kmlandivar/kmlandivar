- 👋 Hi, I’m @kmlandivar
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply DFT -1/2 approach to model defective hBN systems.
-  🔬 My research interests for my PhD thesis are point defects in any 2D material that can be used
  because of their electro- and magneto-optical properties in quantum technologies applications.
- 📫 How to reach me via email: karina.landivar@unimi.it
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Isidoro 🐱
